# Web-Design-Homework

For this homework assignement we created a visualization dashboard website with the visuals we made in the API Homework for plotting weather data.

This dashboard we have created inlcudes individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the
visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots,and another
page where we can view the data used to build them.

Each page was uploaded to github independently, and then we used hyperlinks to reference them in our main landing web page.

The link to the final website is the following: https://carvilla333.github.io/Landing.github.io/

Below I have listed the repositories where each page was deployed to github.io:
